## Disclaimer: 
This is a fan-made game built by one person over the course of a 1.5 MONTHS. THERE WILL BE BUGS. Enjoy the experience! Feel free to reach out if you find a bug that will better the game when fixed, but don't expect your game instance to be fixed. Art used in the banner is not stolen, but also by me, hey isn't that great! Sources and credit for base game play from Pokemon Essentials are cited in game credits.

## Custom Game Functionality
- There is **NO MAP FLY** ability between locations. Enjoy the scenery. Touch grass.
- The player starts with running shoes (ESC KEY to use), a super rod, and a wailmer pail.
- There is a bicycle in the world... it's in the beginning area...
- You can't catch pokemon until you complete the **first cutscene**. (So if you're running through the grass confused, that's why).
- Any screenshots you take in the game (F8 key), will be stored in C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\Pokemon Pixel.
- That's right! There aren't any PKMN Centers! Don't worry though, you'll figure out the mechanics
